# March Madness API

This is a Blue Badge Web API team project. This project uses C#/.NET to create
a web API to track teams, stats, and games through March Madness.  

**In this project we learned:**  

:white_check_mark: Planning and execution of a sprint using Agile methodology  
:white_check_mark: Collaboration as a team using GitHub to create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)  
:white_check_mark: Implementation of n-tier structure  
:white_check_mark: Creation of API endpoints  
:white_check_mark: Testing and debugging APIs  
:white_check_mark: Using foreign keys to connect data tables  

## How It Works

Testing API endpoints can be done using *Postman.*  

You will first need to clone the repository, open the March Madness folder,
and run the MarchMadnessAPI solution in Visual Studio. Once the project is running
on localhost, you can begin testing endpoints in Postman.
